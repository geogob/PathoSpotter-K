The PatoSpotter-K abstract

The achievement of accurate diagnosis based on histological images requires medical 
pathologists with extensive practical experience, because the characteristics of histological 
images leads to a subjective analysis, which often brings difficulty to the accuracy of the 
diagnosis.  Therefore, systems that helps to achieve better diagnoses can minimize doubts and 
increase the effectiveness of medical treatments. This work describes the research and 
development of PathoSpotter-K, a computer system to support in identifying 
Glomerulopathies, which are a family of primary diseases that affects the kidneys. 
The PathoSpotter-K proposes to supply the lack of support work to histopathological diagnosis 
of renal diseases, in the field of Digital Pathology, since a lot has been done in the area of 
neoplasms, but there is few published material regarding the Digital Pathology applied to 
nephrology and hepatology. The initial objective is the classification of proliferative 
Glomerulopathies, but will later be expanded to other kidney and hepatic diseases. The work 
was based on a dataset composed of 811 histological images of glomerulus, and utilized 
classical techniques of image processing areas and digital histopathology. 
The PathoSpotter-K presented a performance of 88.4% accuracy, a result considered satisfactory 
when compared to other similar Digital Pathology works that can be found in the specialized literature.

Keywords: Proliferative Glomerulopathy, Digital Image Processing, Machine Learning, Digital Histopathology.
